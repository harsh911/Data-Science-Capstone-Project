    "Goa is a state in Southern-India and is my birthplace. So the project focuses on the state of Goa and through this project i hope to analyze the trends of Goan people based on their frequently visited places.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me provide a brief overview about the state of Goa. Goa is the smallest state in India having an area of only 3702 sqkm. It is a multicultural state that has a Portuguese culture which is a vestige of the Portuguese rule 70 years ago. Over time Goa has changed drastically in terms of its residents and the types of occupations it offers. Goa is home to Christians, Hindus, Muslims and other religious belief system. Therefore it makes it an ideal location for Business that caters to needs of a variety of people. It is also good location for tourists who like to experience different cultures in a single place. Goa is one of the popular tourist destinations of India due to its vast heritage and location near the coast whose beaches attract tourists from India as well as from foreign countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "Past few years Goa has seen an increase in the tourists visiting it and thus provides a great opportunity to businessmen to cater the needs of these tourists. However, not every location in Goa is ideal for business like resorts, hotels and restaurants. Businessmen from outside Goa try to get in their share of market place by starting their business here. The business location plays a vital role in determining the success of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses poorly located can lead to significant loss for the business owner since it does not provide significant returns. A Chinese restaurant \n",
    "in a residential area will be less likely to gain customers than if it were located in a area which has entertainment and leisure services like movie theaters, shopping malls,theme parks etc. Indian culture favors homemade food and thus Goans are less likely to visit a restaurant unless they are visiting such entertainment and leisure areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience of this analysis are business owners looking to start their business in Goa but do not know which is the ideal location for their business which would help them maximize their profits. One example of this is, where would a person start an restaurant such that he is sure enough people will visit it to sustain the business. "
